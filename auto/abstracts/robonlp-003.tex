We present an optimised multi-modal dialogue agent for interactive learning of visually grounded word meanings from a human tutor, trained on real human-human tutoring data. Within a life-long interactive learning period, the agent, trained using Reinforcement Learning (RL), must be able to handle natural conversations with human users, and achieve  good learning performance (i.e. accuracy) while minimising human effort in the learning process. We train and evaluate this  system in interaction with a simulated human tutor, which is built on the BURCHAK corpus -- a Human-Human Dialogue dataset for the visual learning task. The results show that: 1) The learned policy can coherently interact with the simulated user to achieve the goal of the task (i.e. learning visual attributes of  objects, e.g. colour and shape); and 2) it finds a better trade-off between  classifier accuracy and tutoring costs than hand-crafted rule-based policies, including ones with dynamic policies.
