This paper describes our approach to the SemEval 2017 Task 10: Extracting Keyphrases and Relations from Scientific Publications, specifically to Subtask (B): Classification of identified keyphrases. We explored three different deep learning approaches: a character-level convolutional neural network (CNN), a stacked learner with an MLP meta-classifier, and an attention based Bi-LSTM. From these approaches, we created an ensemble of differently hyper-parameterized systems, achieving a micro-\$F\_1\$-score of 0.63 on the test data. Our approach ranks 2nd (score of 1st placed system: 0.64) out of four according to this official score. However, we erroneously trained 2 out of 3 neural nets (the stacker and the CNN) on only roughly 15\% of the full data, namely, the original development set. When trained on the full data (training\$+\$development), our ensemble has a micro-\$F\_{1}\$-score of 0.69. Our code is available from https://github.com/UKPLab/semeval2017-scienceie.
