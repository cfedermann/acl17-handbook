Media is full of false claims. Even Oxford Dictionaries named ``post-truth'' as the word of 2016. This makes it more important than ever to build systems that can identify the veracity of a story, and the nature of the discourse around it. RumourEval is a SemEval shared task that aims to identify and handle rumours and reactions to them, in text. We present an annotation scheme, a large dataset covering multiple topics --- each having their own families of claims and replies --- and use these to pose two concrete challenges as well as the results achieved by participants on these challenges.
