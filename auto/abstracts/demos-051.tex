We present the first open-source tool for annotating morphosyntactic tense, mood and voice for English, French and German verbal complexes. The annotation is based on a set of language-specific rules, which are applied on dependency trees and leverage information about lemmas, morphological properties and POS-tags of the verbs. Our tool has an average accuracy of about 76\%. The tense, mood and voice features are useful both as features in computational modeling and for corpus-linguistic research.
