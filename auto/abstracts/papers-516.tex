Interactive topic models are powerful tools for those seeking to understand large collections of text. However, existing sampling-based interactive topic modeling approaches scale poorly to large data sets. Anchor methods, which use a single word to uniquely identify a topic, offer the speed needed for interactive work but lack both a mechanism to inject prior knowledge and lack the intuitive semantics needed for user-facing applications. We propose combinations of words as anchors, go- ing beyond existing single word anchor algorithms—an approach we call ``Tan- dem Anchors''. We begin with a synthetic investigation of this approach then apply the approach to interactive topic modeling in a user study and compare it to interac- tive and non-interactive approaches. Tan- dem anchors are faster and more intuitive than existing interactive approaches.
